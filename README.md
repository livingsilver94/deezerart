Deezerart is a [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org) plugin that fetches music album covers from [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com).

Deezer provides free-to-use web APIs and good quality album covers, up to 1000тип1000 pixels. It is in my opinion superior to the other cover providers Picard currently supports.
